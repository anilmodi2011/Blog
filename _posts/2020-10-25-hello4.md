**Phase 2**  - I will subdivide this into 3 categories
	
-	How to prepare finance and management?
	-	watch videos of Manish/hardworking human (better than edutap) from the video section of his FB group. (also available on his youtube channel)
		-	install this extension to speed up FB videos - [Video Speed Controller - Chrome Web Store (google.com)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en)
		-	Use these Notes while watching FB videos(Manish) - [manish - Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1C0gK-HfO9yn7AMw3htJBbGHwH7xCMSKV)
	-	Now it will be easy to go through edutap summary sheets(or any standard book). So make your own notes by combining both.
	- Take edutap/oliveboard or any other test and find lacunes in your preparation.
	- My finance notes - [Evernote shared notebook: RBI Finance](https://www.evernote.com/pub/anilmodi2011/rbifinance#st=p&n=e9ba3f8f-dadf-44c8-9ae5-a36db6077b8b)
